## Origins ✨

Hi! I'm dabby 🐳 (or at least that's what I go by online). I used to be a student at HCI, but I've since graduated. 🎓 I built this website because I wanted to make it easier for people to view the latest posts on HCI's iEMB (iemb.hci.edu.sg). I hope you find it useful! 🙌

This website was built during the COVID era, using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). It's hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), and the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/dabby9734/intelligent-EMB).

If you have any feedback or questions, you can find me on Telegram [@dabby_dabby_chicken_wing](https://t.me/dabby_dabby_chicken_wing) 💬 or email me at [hello@liuweichu.com](mailto:hello@liuweichu.com) 📧.
