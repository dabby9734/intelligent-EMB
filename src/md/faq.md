## Are you going to steal my passwords and hack my HCI account?

No. We store your login credentials as cookies on your browser for session refreshing purposes, and do not upload it to any server. Your connection to this site and our backend api is encrypted and authenticated using TLS 1.3, ECDHE_RSA with P-256 and AES_256_GCM. You have the option of not storing your login credentials when logging in, by unchecking the "Remember me" checkbox, but this will disable automatic session refreshing. Fellow programmers are also free to evaluate the security of this website by examining its source code on Github. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
