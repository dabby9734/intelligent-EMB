## Are you going to steal my passwords and hack my HCI account?

No. We store your login credentials as cookies on your browser for session refreshing purposes, and do not upload it to any server. Your connection to this site and our backend api is encrypted and authenticated using TLS 1.2, ECDHE_RSA with P-256 and AES_256_GCM. You have the option of not storing your login credentials when logging in, by unchecking the "Remember me" checkbox, but this will disable automatic session refreshing. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## The app suddenly stopped working and can’t load any new posts

As [iemb.hci.edu.sg](https://iemb.hci.edu.sg) updates, the app may stop working occasionally. In such a case, an update should be released within a few days to rectify the issue.

## Is there a mobile app for iEMB?

You should try out [better iEMB](https://betteriemb.skytect.one) by The Better iEMB Developers.

## Why does the website occasionally experience increased latency?

intelligent-EMB's backend is powered by Azure Cloud Functions on a "serverless" model. This means that the backend scales up and down according to demand, and may even scale to 0 when idle. To start the backend processes again results in slight latency increase, also known as a cold start. However, once the backend starts up, the latency will be reduced.

## I found a bug, how can I report it?

Please contact us via Telegram [@dabby_dabby_chicken_wing](https://t.me/dabby_dabby_chicken_wing). We, just like The Better iEMB Developers, are currently preoccupied with school work so a response might take some time.

## Will you implement XXX feature?

Idk either.
